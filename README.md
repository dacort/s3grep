# s3grep - Fast Parallel grep for S3

I use `grep` almost daily, but often deal with unstructured content and logs on S3...so I wrote an easy way to `grep` S3!

[![CI](https://github.com/dacort/s3grep/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dacort/s3grep/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`s3grep` is a parallel CLI tool for searching logs and unstructured content in Amazon S3 buckets. It supports .gz decompression, progress bars, and robust error handlingâ€”making it ideal for cloud-native log analysis.

---

## Features

- Parallel, concurrent search across S3 objects
- Supports plain text and `.gz` compressed files
- Progress bars for files and bytes processed
- Case-sensitive and insensitive search
- Line number output option
- Graceful handling of binary files and decompression errors
- Colorized match highlighting
